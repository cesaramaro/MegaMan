## Notes


    What was your project's biggest challenge?
	Our biggest challenge was probably having two or more asteroids on screen at all times.
	
    What was your favorite part of the project?
    My favorite part of the project was whenever something we added worked, and if it didn't, fixing it and making sure it did.
